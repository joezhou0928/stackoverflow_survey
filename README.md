# Stack Overflow Survey
## Overview
This project uses the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results data to explore **what**, **how** and **when** in becoming a qualified developer. Here's the link to the original dataset: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey.

## Files
There are two files except the README.md file:
1. survey_exp.ipynb: This is the Jupyter Notebook file containing the code and exploration.
2. 2020.zip. This is the zip file containing two data tables. 'survey_results_public.csv' is the raw data file and 'survey_results_schema.csv' tells you the original questions asked associated with each column.

## Instructions
1. Download the 2020.zip file and unzip it.
2. Download the survey_exp.ipynb file and put it under the same folder as the .csv files.
3. You are good to go and can run the codes without errors.
